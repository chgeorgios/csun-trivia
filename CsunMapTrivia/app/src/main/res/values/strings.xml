    <string name="rules_title">Rules of CSUN Map Trivia Game\n</string>
    <string name="rules_text">In this game you\'ll be presented with a set of descriptive questions about
        CSUN\'s campus. \nThe goal is to answer all the questions as fast as possible.
        \nAfter clicking the "Play" button, you\'ll be presented with a map of CSUN and a question below it.
        Scroll the map until you find the building you think answers the question best.
        <u>Long press</u> the building on the map. If your answer is correct, you\'ll see a green boarder surround
        the building you chose. If your answer is wrong, the game will show you the correct answer.
        \nAfter submitting your answer, an informative trivia about CSUN will appear where the question was
        and when you\'re ready for the next question, swipe the screen to the left.
        \nOne thing though. If by any reason, the game is sent to the background you\'ll loose your
        points and will have to start a new game. Sorry, but we want to avoid cheating.
        \n\nThink YOU got what it takes to master CSUN Map Trivia?</string>
